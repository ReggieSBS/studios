After a year or 2 not using laravel the coding style is mainly based on dynamic tracking
I wanted to explore how dynamic laravel, or not, laravel has become after a 
few upgrades. this is why you see 

Backend
1. data loading combining arrays and objects.
2. Backend using relationships -> trying join in queries combined with eloquent one to one, one to many etc...
3. exploring traits in models 

Frontend
1. Using jQuery Library in combination with Vue3
2. Using vue3 export in combination with script setup
3. Vue 3 is used for data transfer axios method
4. jQuery is mainly based on UX FX on Design

To Do
1. Waiting for some 3rd party handlings to make request to openAI
2. Descision making on Frontend or Backend handling (For now it's backend using guzzle) 
OpenAI Laravel package uses PHP 8.1. this is incombitable with APP version php 8.0
3. Frontend npm package is combitable with Vue3 only axios calls and wait for sync methods
in vue will slow down user experience.

* Optional is to handle the request using job commands in laravel but because the context
of the aspects of the app (E-book and Movie) are so compartimentalized that content reading
doesn't effect user experience in request handling.
